# Embracing .NET Core

It comes with a huge sorrow to me, that I have to abort my previous project, "Considering .NET Core on Linux". That topic was of great importance for me, from both the worlds as both the parties came together. However, I had to face quite a lot of issues in the midway as I was writing the book and then later on, that plug was ultimately pulled and the core concepts that I spent most time explaining, were removed &mdash; for example, project.json. 

There were a few other major updates that got added in the .NET Core framework, and I feel like the previous content would never fit what was to come in this one and what is to come in .NET Core 2.0. 

For that, I am updating the previous repository, removing it, and creating this new one to support me on the journey to teach you how to _embrace .NET Core_! Because, that's just the way it will happen... :smile:
